# User Functionalities
### 1. Login 

- we get the body (email,password,remeberme}
- check whether the user is existing or not and compare the passowords using bcrypt.compare(enteredPassword,password in database)
- Then update the user prefernces using findOneAndUpdate
- Now you get the device info to give alerts if user logged in multiple devices for that we use **useragent** and if user is logged in multiple devices the it sends the email to the original user and update the current device info to userSchema
- After that create the jwt token using **jwt**
- So this is a cookie based authentication ,we can store this token in cookies ,so please mention options ,In the options there is a property called maxAge based on this the cookie is session cookie or persistant cookie
- create the refresh token also once the our original token expired,then the refresh token creates the normal token again and we also store like this res.cookie(”refresh token”,refreshToken,options)
- Get the login details (`email`, `password`, `rememberMe`) from the request body.
- Find the user in the database and compare the entered password with the stored hash using **bcrypt.compare**.
- Update the user’s preferences (like rememberMe) and store device info using **useragent**; send an alert if multiple devices are detected.
- Generate a **JWT access token** and store it in a cookie; use `maxAge` to decide whether it’s a session or persistent cookie.
- Create a **refresh token**, also stored in a cookie, to issue a new access token when the old one expires.
- Return success response with tokens set in cookies, completing cookie-based authentication.


### 2. Uploading the Images

- for uploading the images we use multer and cloudinary and sharp
- create your folder automatically using multer
- The multer is  middleware to parse the multipart/form-data and we use sharp to reisize the image and stored in local server
- Then we upload the resized file url into cloudinary it gives the public image url and we update in database.
- And simply remove the old avatar from the cloudinary

### 3.Delete the Avatar

- For deleting the avatar ,first we check whether the user is logged in or not
- Then we get the avatar from the database and we get the url,which has publicId
- for deleting the avatar,we can delete in cloudinary and database as well as
- for deleting ,we can extract the publicId and destroy with publicId and updating In the database as well as

### 4.Delete User

- first set the deletion periods days in milliseconds then update the isDeletedField ,then send the conformation email to the user
- Schedule job at `runAt` (future date).
- When job executes:
    - Find all participants linked to the user.
    - Remove user from all meetings.
    - Delete participant records.
    - Delete user preferences and account.
    - Send final email.
    - Log success or errors.
- Client is informed that deletion is **scheduled**, not immediate.

### 5.Magic Link

- first we get the email from the body ,then check whether the user existing or not
- Then generate the magicToken with the help of user email and user id and expires in 10m
- Now construct the URL using URL object,then attach the magic token to that URL
- Then send the MagicLink to the respective user

### 6.Verify magic Link

- first you get the token from req.params
- Then decoded the token and we get the id and email
- After this genrate the login jwt token using id and email
- Then check the device detection also and update the current login date and current device info
- Then keep this login token in cookie
- Then create the frontend url using new URL after creating the redirecting url using frontend url and “/home”
- Then simply redirect it


### 7. Worker(child process)

- In normal js __dirname gives the current folder path and __filename gives the current file path
- But node.js does not give directly
- There is fileURLToPath(import.meta.url) gives  file path
- There is dirname(filepath) it gives folder path
- **await fse.ensureDir(REPORTS_DIR);**what is does is,if the folder is not created Yet then it creates suppose the folder is already created do nothing

## 🔹 Function: `sendOTP`

👉 **Purpose:** Generate a one-time password (OTP), save/update it in the database, and send it to the user’s email.

### Step-by-step explanation:

- `const email = req.body.email;` → Get the user’s email from the request body.
- `const otp = crypto.randomInt(100000, 999999).toString();` → Generate a secure random 6-digit OTP (better than `Math.random()`).
- `await OtpModel.findOneAndUpdate(...)` → Store OTP in the `OtpModel` collection.
    - If the email already exists → update the OTP and `createdAt`.
    - If not → create a new OTP record (thanks to `upsert: true`).
- `await sendVerificationEmail(email, otp);` → Send the OTP to the user’s email.
- `res.status(201).json({ message: "OTP sent successfully" });` → Respond back to the client confirming OTP was sent.
- If anything goes wrong → `catch (error)` returns a 500 error with `"Failed to send OTP"`.

👉 **In short:** This function **creates and sends a 6-digit OTP** to the user’s email, ensuring only one record per email is stored (update/insert).

---

## 🔹 Function: `verifyOTP`

👉 **Purpose:** Verify if the OTP is valid, create a new user, set their preferences, and send a welcome mail.

### Step-by-step explanation:

- `const { email, otp, password, name } = req.body;` → Extract input values from request.
- `const otpData = await OtpModel.findOne({ email, otp });` → Check if the OTP exists for the given email.
    - If not found → return `"Invalid OTP"`.
- Compare `createdAt` with current time → ensure OTP is not expired (`>6000 sec`).
    - If expired → return `"OTP expired"`.
- `const existingUser = await UserModel.findOne({ email });` → Make sure the user doesn’t already exist.
    - If exists → return `"Email already exists"`.
- `const user = await UserModel.create({...})` → Create a new user with name, email, and password.
- `await OtpModel.deleteOne({ email });` → Remove OTP record after successful use (one-time only).
- `const userSettingsNew = await Preferences.create({ userId: user._id });` → Create default preferences/settings for the new user.
- `await UserModel.findByIdAndUpdate(user._id, { settings: userSettingsNew._id });` → Link the preferences to the user account.
- `sendWelComeMail(email)` → Send a welcome email (done asynchronously, doesn’t block response).
- Finally → `res.status(200).json({ message: "OTP verified successfully" });`.
- If any error happens in between → `catch` block logs it and returns `"Failed to verify OTP"`.

## 🔹 Function: `createCheckoutSession`

👉 **Purpose:** Create a Stripe checkout session so the user can start a subscription (like Premium plan).

### Step-by-step explanation:

- `const session = await stripe.checkout.sessions.create({...})` → Creates a new checkout session with Stripe.
- `customer_email: req.user.email` → Uses the logged-in user’s email for Stripe billing.
- `payment_method_types: ["card"]` → Allows card payments only.
- `mode: "subscription"` → Tells Stripe this is a **recurring subscription** (not one-time).
- `line_items: [{ price: PLANS.premium.priceId, quantity: 1 }]` → Defines what the user is buying:
    - Uses the `priceId` from your `PLANS` config (Premium plan).
    - Quantity is 1 (one subscription).
- `success_url` → If payment is successful, Stripe will redirect to `/subscription-success`.
- `cancel_url` → If user cancels checkout, redirect to `/subscription-cancel`.
- `billing_address_collection: "required"` → Forces user to enter billing address.
- `metadata: { userId: req.user.id }` → Attach the user’s ID for tracking (helpful in webhooks).
- `res.json({ url: session.url })` → Send the session URL back so the frontend can redirect the user to Stripe checkout.
- If something fails → `catch` block returns a `500` error with the error message.

👉 **In short:** This function creates a Stripe checkout session where the logged-in user can subscribe to your Premium plan.

---

## 🔹 Function: `createBillingPortalSession`

👉 **Purpose:** Allow users to manage their subscription (update card, cancel plan, etc.) via Stripe’s billing portal.

### Step-by-step explanation:

- `const userId = req.user.id;` → Get the currently logged-in user’s ID.
- `const subscription = await Subscription.findOne({ user: userId });` → Find the subscription document in your DB for this user.
- `if (!subscription || !subscription.stripeCustomerId)` → Check if this user has an active Stripe customer account.
    - If not → return error `"No active Stripe customer found"`.
- `const portalSession = await stripe.billingPortal.sessions.create({...})` → Create a new Stripe **billing portal session**.
- `customer: subscription.stripeCustomerId` → Connect this session to the user’s Stripe account.
- `return_url: \`${process.env.FRONTEND_URL}/account``→ After managing subscription, user comes back to`/account`.
- `res.json({ url: portalSession.url })` → Send the billing portal URL to frontend.
- If anything fails → log the error and return `500` with error message.

👉 **In short:** This function lets a user open Stripe’s billing portal so they can manage their subscription details themselves.
